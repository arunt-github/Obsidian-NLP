- Text input and Data Collection
	- Data Collection : Gathering text data from various sources such as websites, books, social media, or proprietary databases.
	- Data Storage : Storing the collected text data in a structured format, such as a database or a collection of documents.
- Text Preprocessing
	- Tokenization
	- Lowercasing
	- Stopword Removal
	- Punctual Removal
	- Stemming and Lemmatization
	- Text normalization
- Text Representation
	- Bag of Words (BoW) : Representing text as a collection of words, ignoring grammar and word order but keeping track of word frequency.
	- Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) : A statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
	- Word Embeddings : Using dense vector representations of words where semantically similar words are closer together in the vector space (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
- Feature Extraction
	- N-grams : Capturing sequences of N words to preserve some context and word order.
	- Syntactic Features : Using parts of speech tags, syntactic dependencies, and parse trees.
	- Semantic Features : Leveraging word embeddings and other representations to capture word meaning and context.
- Model Selection and Training
	- Supervised Learning : Using labeled data to train models like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
	- Unsupervised Learning : Applying techniques like clustering or topic modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) on unlabeled data.
	- Pre-trained Models : Utilizing pre-trained language models such as BERT, GPT, or transformer-based models that have been trained on large corpora.
- Model Deployment and Inference
	- Text Classification : Categorizing text into predefined classes (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).
	- Named Entity Recognition (NER) : Identifying and classifying entities in the text.
	- Machine Translation : Translating text from one language to another.
	- Question Answering : Providing answers to questions based on the context provided by text data.
- Evaluation and Optimization
	- Evaluating the performance of the NLP algorithm using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and others.
	- Hyperparameter Tuning : Adjusting model parameters to improve performance.
	- Error Analysis : Analyzing errors to understand model weaknesses and improve robustness.
- Iteration and Improvement
