1. Text Processing and Preprocessing In NLP
	- Tokenization
	- Stemming and Lemmatization
	- Stopword Removal
	- Text Normalization
2. Syntax and Parsing In NLP
	- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging** : Assigning parts of speech to each word in a sentence (e.g: noun, verb, adjective).
	- **Dependency Parsing** : Analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence to identify relationships between words
	- **Constituency Parsing** : Breaking down a sentence into its constituent parts or phrases (e.g., noun phrases, verb phrases).
3. Semantic Analysis
	- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** : Identifying and classifying entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.
	- **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)** : Determining which meaning of a word is used in a given context.
	- Coreference Resolution : Identifying when different words refer to the same entity in a text (e.g., “he” refers to “John”).
4. Information Extraction
	- Entity Extraction : Identifying specific entities and their relationships within the text.
	- Relation Extraction : Identifying and categorizing the relationships between entities in a text
5. Text Classification In NLP
	- Sentiment Analysis : Determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a text (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
	- Topic Modeling : Identifying topics or themes within a large collection of documents.
	- Spam Detection : Classifying text as spam or not spam.
6. Language Generation
	- Machine Translation : Translating text from one language to another.
	- Text Summarization : Producing a concise summary of a larger text.
	- Text Generation : Automatically generating coherent and contextually relevant text
7. Speech Processing
	- Speech Recognition : Converting spoken language into text.
	- Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis : Converting written text into spoken language.
8. Question Answering
	- Retrieval-Based QA : Finding and returning the most relevant text passage in response to a query.
	- Generative QA : Generating an answer based on the information available in a text corpus.
9. Dialogue Systems
	- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants : Enabling systems to engage in conversations with users, providing responses and performing tasks based on user input.
